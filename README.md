## How I work
Short, practical bullets that tell collaborators what to expect.

- Goal-oriented: I focus on shipping measurable outcomes.
- Small, iterative steps: prefer incremental delivery and fast feedback.
- Clear communication: PRs with context, issues with acceptance criteria.
- Testing-first mindset: automated tests and CI for stable releases.

## What I’m proud of
- Shipped X feature that increased [metric] by Y%  
- Built a reusable component/system used across N apps  
- Improved CI time by X% and reduced flaky tests by Y%

(Replace with 2–4 real, quantified highlights.)
